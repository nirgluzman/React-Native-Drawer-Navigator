### Native Stack Navigator vs. Stack Navigator

- `Native Stack` uses the Android and IOS native navigation systems to navigate between pages ->
  offers NATIVE performance .
- `Native Stack` has an improved performance compared to `Stack`.
- `Stack` does not really "navigate", but instead will mimic navigation in JavaScript and generic
  Views (a bit like how "Single-Page Application" web apps mimic web navigation).
